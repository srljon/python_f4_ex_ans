"""
Implement a quadratic equation solver using
Python variables and operators. The quadratic formula is used
to find the roots of a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

** Implement and calculate the following equation in Python:

x = (-5 + (5^2 - (4x1x6)^0.5)) / 2x1 = -2.0

"""
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
x = (-5 + (5**2 - (4*1*6))**0.5) / 2*1
